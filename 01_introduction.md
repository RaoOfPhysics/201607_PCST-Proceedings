# Introduction

## Motivations for this project

Much research into the attitudes of scientists towards public engagement has involved studying fields of research with either a direct or an immediate impact to human life and society (e.g. climate change, genetically modified organisms, nuclear power), but the literature is lacking when it comes to fields such as particle physics that are less accessible or "every-day" to a lay public.
Anecdotally, the author has found that science-communication efforts within fundamental sciences are often classified as "deficit-style" approaches, or ones that seek to educate &mdash; rather than engage &mdash; the audiences being communicated with.
However, no solutions to this seem to have been proposed.
It is therefore pertinent that these fields of research are sufficiently represented in the science-communication discourse, in order to ensure that the conversation, and subsequent policy recommendations, are not biased by the more accessible areas of research.

## Representing particle physics

CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, is the premier research facility for high-energy physics.
It is estimated that around half of the 20,000 or so particle physicists around the world conduct their research at CERN.
The laboratory can therefore be thought to be an accurate (???) representation of the particle-physics community.
To represent the population of particle-physics researchers, the sample chosen is the CMS Collaboration, which discovered the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider located at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics.
Named after the Compact Muon Solenoid particle detector, the collaboration counts among its members over 4000 scientists and engineers from nearly 200 institutes representing more than 40 countries.
The international but close-knit nature of the collaboration makes CMS a unique source of rich, novel data into cross-national and cross-cultural attitudes towards science communication.

## Defining "public engagement"

Rather than using the term "public engagement", the research project consistently uses the term "outreach" as a synonym, since this latter term is used both at CERN and within the wider particle-physics community.
