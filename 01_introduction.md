# Introduction

## Motivations for this project

Much research into the attitudes of scientists towards public engagement has involved studying fields of research with either a direct or an immediate impact to human life and society (e.g. climate change, genetically modified organisms, nuclear power), but the literature is lacking when it comes to fields such as particle physics that are less accessible or "every-day" to a lay public.
Anecdotally, the author has found that science-communication efforts within fundamental sciences are often classified as "deficit-style" approaches, or ones that seek to educate -- rather than engage -- the audiences being communicated with.
While it might be a valid argument, no solutions to this seem to have been proposed.
It is therefore pertinent that these fields of research are sufficiently represented in the science-communication discourse, in order to ensure that the conversation, and subsequent policy recommendations, are not biased by the more accessible areas of research.

Secondly, the literature itself is dominated by researchers who are native or near-native speakers of English.
This inadvertently results in the vocabulary used by the community not being very clear to non-native speakers, among them scientists and researchers in other fields.
It also ignores the socio-cultural differences between various nationalities, which might not all have their science-communication priorities or models aligned perfectly with the largely Western European ones.

An international study of scientists involved in fundamental research should go some way towards addressing, and perhaps remedying, these concerns.

## Representing particle physics

CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, is the premier research facility for high-energy physics.
It is estimated that around half of the 20,000 or so particle physicists around the world conduct their research the laboratory.
Science-communication research involving those working at CERN can therefore be thought to be applicable to the particle-physics community as a whole.
Further, to represent the population of particle-physics researchers, the sample chosen for this study is the CMS Collaboration, which is one of the four large collaborations performing research at the Large Hadron Collider and which discovered the Higgs boson in 2012.
Named after the Compact Muon Solenoid particle detector, the collaboration counts among its members over 4000 scientists and engineers from nearly 200 institutes representing more than 40 countries (as of June 2015).
The international but close-knit nature of the collaboration makes CMS a unique source of rich, novel data into cross-national and cross-cultural attitudes towards science communication.

## Defining "public engagement"

For the purposes of this project, the term chosen to refer to "public engagement" is in fact "outreach", since this latter term is used both at CERN and within the wider particle-physics community to refer to activities ranging from working with schools to direct dialogue with the public to disseminating information through the media.
Indeed, a recent re-structure of the laboratory's departments saw the creation of the "Education, Communication and Outreach" team, while global public engagement in the field has long been co√∂rdinated by the International Particle Physics Outreach Group.
This approach also has some academic backing, with Crettaz von Roten (2011, p.54) acknowledging that the term is used to refer to all science-communication activities "designed for an audience outside academia".
