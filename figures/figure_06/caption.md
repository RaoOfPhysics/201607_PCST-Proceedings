**\label{fig:fig6} Communicating with the Non-Specialist Public** The plots here show how the survey respondents rated the non-specialist public when it came to their knowledge, the importance of communicating with them and the ease of doing so. A fourth plot also shows the votes for the three categories summed up to give a general overview of how ``favourable'' this audience is for the respondents.
