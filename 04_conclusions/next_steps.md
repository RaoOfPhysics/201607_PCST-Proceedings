## Next steps

The work presented at PCST 2016 is only a small part of a much larger research project.
Although certain themes have emerged from the preliminary analysis presented here, they will be treated more thoroughly in future analysis of the quantative data.
In addition, questions such as whether the respondents' attitudes towards outreach changed favourably over the course of responding to the survey -- or whether these responses correlate with the respondents' ages, for example -- will be explored via personal interviews during the period of qualitative-data collection.
