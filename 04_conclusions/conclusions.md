# Conclusions

The fact that the majority of the respondents state that they have previously participated in outreach is indicative of the self-selection bias involved in such methods of data collection.
It would seem that these respondents are invested, emotionally or professionally, in outreach activities and therefore chose to respond to the survey.

The questions regarding audiences groups required the respondents to select a value from 1 to 5 corresponding to how they rated the respective audiences' importance, knowledge and ease of communication (1 being a very unfavourable rating and 5 being the most favourable).
These ratings are called Likert scales and represent ordinal data.
By definition, Likert scales limit the statistical analyses that can be performed on data they produce.
Conclusions must therefore be painted with fairly broad strokes and interpreted with care.
That said, we can make some definitive statements regarding the results presented here.

**[FIX THE TONE HERE!]**
Researchers in the particle-physics community value communication with their colleagues the most.
Science journalists were afforded a surprising amount of value (and respect?) by the community.
I say surprising because, and this is entirely anecdotal, there are frequent complaints among scientists about journalists not doing a good enough job of explaining their research.
Perhaps this is restricted to journalists whose professional beat is not science.
