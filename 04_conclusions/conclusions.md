# Conclusions

**[FIX THE TONE HERE!]**
Researchers in the particle-physics community value communication with their colleagues the most.
Science journalists were afforded a surprising amount of value (and respect?) by the community.
I say surprising because, and this is entirely anecdotal, there are frequent complaints among scientists about journalists not doing a good enough job of explaining their research.
Perhaps this is restricted to journalists whose professional beat is not science.
