# Conclusions

In terms of the importance of communicating with certain audiences, the responses to this survey can be compared with similar questions asked in a previous survey by \citet{royal_society_survey_2006}.
In the Royal Society survey, the respondents were asked to rate the importance of communicating with a list of audiences, two of which map exactly with the audiences mentioned in this paper: (1) science journalists and (2) the non-specialist public.
Notably, both these groups had their importance rated considerably higher than in the Royal Society survey **[TODO: ADD NUMBERS and/or PLOTS]**.
Then again, the majority of the respondents to the Royal Society survey had not participated in any outreach activities in the 12 months prior to the survey.
It may therefore be that the differences between the two sets of data are because the respondents within the particle-physics group had recently engaged in outreach and consequently viewed these audiences more favourably than their counterparts surveyed by the Royal Society.
