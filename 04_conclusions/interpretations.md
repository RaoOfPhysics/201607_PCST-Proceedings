## Interpretations

Likert scales represent ordinal data, which, by definition, limit the statistical analyses that can be performed on data they produce.
Conclusions must be painted with fairly broad strokes and interpreted with care.
That said, we can make some definitive statements regarding the results presented here.

**[FIX THE TONE HERE!]**
As expected, researchers in the particle-physics community value communication with their colleagues most favourably.
Science journalists were afforded a surprising amount of value (and respect?) by the community.
I say surprising because, and this is entirely anecdotal, there are frequent complaints among scientists about journalists not doing a good enough job of explaining their research.
Perhaps this is restricted to journalists whose professional beat isn't science.
