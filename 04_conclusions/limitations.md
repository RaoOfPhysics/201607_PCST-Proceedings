## Limitations

The fact that the majority of the respondents state that they have previously participated in outreach is indicative of the self-selection bias involved in such methods of data collection.
It would seem that these respondents are invested, emotionally or professionally, in outreach activities and therefore chose to respond to the survey.

The questions regarding audiences groups required the respondents to select a value from 1 to 5 on a Likert scale corresponding to how they rated the respective audiences' importance, knowledge and ease of communication (1 being a very unfavourable rating and 5 being the most favourable).
By definition, Likert scales limit the statistical analyses that can be performed on data they produce.
Conclusions must therefore be interpreted with care.
