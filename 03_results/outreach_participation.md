## Outreach participation

The respondents were asked whether or not they had previously participated in any outreach activities.
Further, they were asked to provide an estimate of the number of outreach activities they had been involved in in the preceding 12 months and the amount of time they had devoted to these activities.
The majority of respondents stated that they had indeed participated in outreach activities in the past (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}).
An approximately equal percentage of men and women had said they had done so.

The survey also asked respondents to pick the statement they most agreed with from the following:

> - I plan to participate in an outreach activity in the next 12 months.
> - I do not plan to participate in an outreach activity in the next 12 months.
> - I may participate in an outreach activity in the next 12 months.

These options can be interpreted respectively as "Yes", "No" and "Maybe" responses to the question: "Do you plan to participate in an outreach activity in the next 12 months?"
The responses to this question were rather interesting (see Figure \ref{fig:fig2}): a small number of those who had previously participated said they would not (9 out of 348), but a significant number of those who had previously never participated said that they definitely would or may participate in outreach in the near future (6 and 21 out of 43 respectively).
It is unclear whether this change in attitude was a consequence of thinking about outreach participation in general while responding to the survey.
