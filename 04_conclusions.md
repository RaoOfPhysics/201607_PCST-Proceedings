# Conclusions

The fact that the majority of the respondents state that they have previously participated in outreach is indicative of the self-selection bias involved in such methods of data collection.
It would seem that these respondents are invested, emotionally or professionally, in outreach activities and therefore chose to respond to the survey.

## Interpretations

Likert scales represent ordinal data, which, by definition, limit the statistical analyses that can be performed on data they produce.
Conclusions must be painted with fairly broad strokes and interpreted with care.
That said, we can make some definitive statements regarding the results presented here.

**[FIX THE TONE HERE!]**
As expected, researchers in the particle-physics community value communication with their colleagues most favourably.
Science journalists were afforded a surprising amount of value (and respect?) by the community.
I say surprising because, and this is entirely anecdotal, there are frequent complaints among scientists about journalists not doing a good enough job of explaining their research.
Perhaps this is restricted to journalists whose professional beat isn't science.

## Next steps

The work presented at PCST 2016 is only a small part of a much larger research project.
Analysis of the remaining audience groups has since been performed but is not included in this report.
Whether or not people's attitudes towards outreach changed favourably over the course of responding to the survey is something that will be explored via personal interviews during the period of qualitative-data collection.
