## Data

Over the course of the data-collection period, a total of 402 responses were received.
Of these, 10 were duplicates (the respondents seemingly having forgotten that they had already answered the questions).
The duplicates were used as a sort of "control" to check whether people's responses had changed significantly over time: no substantial changes (a Likert rating of 4 may have gone to 5 or vice versa) were observed.
One of the responses was invalid for other reasons.
This left a total of 391 responses for further analysis, or slightly less than 10% of the collaboration.
