# Introduction

Much research into the attitudes of scientists towards public engagement has involved studying fields of research with either a direct or an immediate impact on human life and society (e.g. climate change, genetically modified organisms, nuclear power), but the literature is lacking when it comes to fields such as particle physics that are less accessible or "every-day" to a lay public.
Anecdotally, the author has found that science-communication efforts within fundamental sciences are often classified as "deficit-style" approaches, or ones that seek to educate -- rather than engage -- the audiences being communicated with.
While this might be a valid criticism, no solutions seem to have been proposed.
It is therefore pertinent that fields of research such as particle physics are sufficiently represented in the science-communication discourse, in order to ensure that the conversation, and subsequent policy recommendations, are not biased by the more accessible areas of research.

Secondly, the literature itself is dominated by researchers who are native or near-native speakers of English.
This inadvertently results in the vocabulary used by the community not being very clear to non-native speakers, among them scientists and researchers in other fields.
It also ignores the socio-cultural differences between various nationalities, which might not all have their science-communication priorities or models aligned perfectly with the (largely) Western European ones.

An international study of scientists involved in fundamental research should go some way towards addressing, and perhaps remedying, these concerns.
