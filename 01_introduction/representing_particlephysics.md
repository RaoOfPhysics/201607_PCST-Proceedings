## Representing particle physics

CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, is the premier research facility for high-energy physics.
It is estimated that around half of the 20,000 or so particle physicists around the world conduct their research at the laboratory.
Science-communication research involving those working at CERN can therefore be thought to be applicable to the particle-physics community as a whole.
Further, to represent the population of particle-physics researchers, the sample chosen for this study was the CMS Collaboration, which is one of the four large collaborations performing research at the Large Hadron Collider and which discovered the Higgs boson in 2012.
Named after the Compact Muon Solenoid particle detector, the collaboration counts among its members over 4000 scientists and engineers from nearly 200 institutes representing more than 40 countries (as of June 2015).
The international but close-knit nature of the collaboration makes CMS a unique source of rich, novel data into cross-national and cross-cultural attitudes towards science communication.
