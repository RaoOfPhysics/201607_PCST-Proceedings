## Defining public engagement

For the purposes of this project, the term selected to refer to "public engagement" is in fact "outreach", since this latter term is used both at CERN and within the wider particle-physics community to refer to activities ranging from working with schools to direct dialogue with the public to disseminating information through the media.
Indeed, a recent re-structure of the laboratory's departments saw the creation of the "Education, Communication and Outreach" team, while global public engagement in the field has long been coordinated by the International Particle Physics Outreach Group.
This choice of the term "outreach" is also supported by others such as \citet[p.~54]{crettaz_von_roten_gender_2011}, who acknowledges that it is used to refer to all science-communication activities "designed for an audience outside academia".
