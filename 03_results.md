## Outreach participation

The majority of respondents stated that they had participated in outreach activities in the past.
The ratio of men to women who said they had done so was roughly the same.
What was interesting to note were the responses to the question of whether the respondents would participate in outreach in the coming 12 months (at the time of answering the survey): a small number of those who had previously participated said they wouldn't, but a significant number of those who had previously never participated said that they definitely would or may participate in outreach in the near future.
It is unclear whether this was a consequence of thinking about outreach participation in general while responding to the survey.

## Communication audiences

Among audiences with whom the researchers (may) communicate, colleagues were ranked as the most important group, the most knowledgeable group and the easiest to communicate with about one's research.
When it came to importance and ease of communication, science journalists, school students and the non-specialist public were ranked approximately on par with each other, although science journalists were thought to be more knowledgeable than the other two groups.
