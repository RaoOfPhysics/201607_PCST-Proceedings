This paper presents early results from research into the attitudes of the particle-physics community towards science communication (specifically, towards "public engagement" or "outreach").
To represent the population of particle-physics researchers, the sample chosen is the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Collaboration, at the Large Hadron Collider located at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics.
Named after the Compact Muon Solenoid particle detector, the collaboration counts among its members over 4000 scientists and engineers from nearly 200 institutes representing more than 40 countries.
The paper focuses on analysis of quantitative data, which were collected via an in-depth online survey distributed to the entire CMS Collaboration in early 2015.
Over the data-collection period, 391 valid responses were recorded.
Most of the respondents stated that they had participated in outreach activities in the past, and ranked their colleagues as the most important, most knowledgeable and easiest to communicate with, when it comes to matters of their (the respondents') research topics.

The project is part of the author's research towards a PhD in Science Communication.
