# Methods and data

## Methods

It being impossible to canvass all 4000+ members of the CMS Collaboration, or ensure that all members of a random sample would respond to a survey, it was decided to circulate an electronic survey to the entire collaboration, soliciting as many responses as possible.
This approach had the endorsement of the management of the collaboration.
The survey was developed using existing questionnaires as templates, so as to have other research with which to compare this work, but was tailored to address the specific research questions of the research project.

### Survey pilot

The survey was piloted with a small number of researchers working at CERN but not belonging to the CMS Collaboration.
These researchers were of the following nationalities: the United States of America (America), the Russian Federation (Russia) and the People's Republic of China (China).
The nationalities were chosen to be different enough culturally and linguistically to identify patterns in the responses or difficulties with accessing the questions presented in the survey itself.

The pilot study identified several issues with the questions included in the survey.
The first was that the term "outreach" was not clear to people from Russia and China &mdash; instead, the term they thought of when referring to these kinds of activities was "popularisation".
It therefore became necessary to include a reminder at the beginning of the survey that the term "outreach" may sometimes be called "popularisation".

### Final survey

The survey was tweaked based on two sessions of feedback from the pilot respondents, and was then uploaded to a server at CERN for distribution.
Access to the website hosting the survey was restricted to members of the CMS Collaboration.
All responses to the survey were accompanied by the name of the respondent.
Additional information about individual respondents was extracted from the internal database of CMS members.

The link to the survey was circulated to the entire collaboration via internal e-mail.
Periodic reminders were sent to the whole collaboration thrice.
Each e-mail sent generated a flurry of responses that died down within a few days.
Noticing a lack of responses from engineers within the collaboration, this group was contacted separately with a request to respond to the survey.
Also, members from countries with a proportionally low response rate were also re-contacted.

## Data

Over the course of the data-collection period, a total of 402 responses were received.
Of these, 10 were duplicates (the respondents seemingly having forgotten that they had already answered the questions) and 1 was invalid for other reasons.
This left a total of 391 responses for further analysis.
