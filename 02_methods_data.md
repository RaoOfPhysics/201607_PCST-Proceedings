# Methods and data

## Methods

It being impossible to canvass all 4000+ members of the CMS Collaboration, or ensure that all members of a random sample would be willing to respond to a survey, it was decided to circulate an electronic survey to the entire collaboration, soliciting as many responses as possible.
This approach had the endorsement of the management of the collaboration.
The survey was developed using existing questionnaires as templates, so as to have other research with which to compare this work, but it was tailored to address the specific research questions of the research project.

### Survey pilot

The survey was piloted with a small number of researchers who work at CERN but who do not belong to the CMS Collaboration.
These researchers were of the following nationalities: the United States of America (America), the Russian Federation (Russia) and the People's Republic of China (China).
The countries were chosen to be different enough culturally and linguistically to identify patterns in the responses or difficulties with accessing the questions presented in the survey itself.
These countries have the following representation within CMS (as of June 2015):

|Country|CMS members|
|:---|:---|
|America|1442|
|Russia|295|
|China|94|

Note: This use of the term "country" here does not refer to the nationality of the individual researcher, but to the country their institute or university is based in.

The pilot study identified several issues with the questions included in the survey.
The first was that the term "outreach" was not clear to people from Russia and China -- instead, the term they thought of when referring to these kinds of activities was "popularisation".
It therefore became necessary to include the following note at the beginning of the survey:

> The term "outreach" refers to all science communication and education activities that bring scientific research to audiences outside the research community. It is also known as "popularisation".

### Final survey

The survey was tweaked based on two sessions of feedback from the pilot respondents, and was then uploaded to a server at CERN for distribution.
Access to the website hosting the survey was restricted to members of the CMS Collaboration.
Although the survey was confidential, it wasn't anonymous: that is, the survey software recorded the names of all respondents along with their responses.
Identifying the respondents was necessary in order to extract additional information about the individual respondents (such as their age, nationality, institutional affiliation etc.) from the internal database of CMS members.

The link to the survey was circulated to the entire collaboration via internal e-mail.
Periodic reminders were sent to the whole collaboration thrice.
Each e-mail generated a flurry of responses that died down within a few days.
Noticing a lack of responses from engineers within the collaboration, they were contacted separately with a request to respond to the survey.
Also, members from countries with a proportionally low response rate were also re-contacted.
However, it is important to note that these last two reminders (engineers and low-response countries) did not yield many new responses.

## Data

Over the course of the data-collection period, a total of 402 responses were received.
Of these, 10 were duplicates (the respondents seemingly having forgotten that they had already answered the questions).
The duplicates were used as a sort of "control" to check whether people's responses had changed significantly over time: no substantial changes (a Likert rating of 4 may have gone to 5 or vice versa) were observed.
One of the responses was invalid for other reasons.
This left a total of 391 responses for further analysis, or slightly less than 10% of the collaboration.
